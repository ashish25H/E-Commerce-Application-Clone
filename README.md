# Usage
Once the application is running, you can use the navigation menu to browse through the different product categories. When you find a product you like, you can click on it to view its details and add it to your cart. You can view your cart at any time by clicking on the cart icon in the navigation menu.

To buy a product, click on the "Buy" button on the dummy buy page. This will simulate a purchase and add the product to your order history.
